# CopyFilePathAsMDLink
An Alfred workflow to copy the selected file's path as a markdown link

This workflow copies the path of the currently selected file in finder as an MD link.

For example, if you select a file called "test.txt" located in "/Users/myuser/", then you trigger the workflow with "fmd", your clipboard contents will be: '[test.txt](file:///Users/myuser/test.txt)', which can immediately be pasted into a markdown editor as a file link.
